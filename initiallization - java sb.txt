go to spring initiallizer -
https://start.spring.io/

make the file and done

some of the file structures -- 
1) controllers(write @RestController at the top) - where we write the api call - post/get/put/delete etc - get /login, /signup etc

2) models - where we write the model that goes into the db(basically what are saving) - 
eg if Signup model then - what we want to save in the backend - eg name, email, password

3) dto(data transfer object) - the schema that we want to call before saving. Like in js we can use zod to make 
the schema, and then work on that. similarly, eg in signup we would like to have name, email, password, confirm password,
and n number of different fields to verify but we don't want to save all the things in the dataBase(like confirm pass)
so we call dto and then save what we want in the model.

4) services(write @Service at the top) - where the actual work takes place. the controller calls the service to work
